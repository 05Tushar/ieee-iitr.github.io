## Hello Juniors!

Enjoying with friends and partying? Well, we hope so. One advice: don't do drugs. ;)

Since this is the first big vacation, you should spend this time productively.

Apologies on being late, but here are some suggestions we thought to be useful:

# Fun and enjoyment
The first and foremost objective of any vacation is fun. At first glance it might not seem so, but quarantine and fun can go hand in hand! Binge your favorite TV shows, movies, YouTube channels, workout in your home, video-call your relatives, or try your culinary skills. Observe good personal hygiene and practice social distancing.

# Academia
Starting the courses of the next semester is a good idea. The courses are interesting and some of them (or at least their basics) can easily be understood, by reading the books of the respective course. However, we would strictly recommend that you devote your time to learning something new as you may not get time to learn new things during the semester.

Additionally, you can learn from online courses which can be found on these websites:

[EDX](https://www.edx.org/)

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

[MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/)

[Udacity](https://in.udacity.com/)

[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/teaching-and-academics/engineering/)

Universities like MIT offer free online courses on a variety of subjects. You can access these courses [here](http://ocw.mit.edu)

You must try something that you will not learn in your courses. We would recommend to go for courses from the above-mentioned sites, choose one which does not have many prerequisites and complete it by watching lectures according to your pace, say 1-2 at a day. You can try your hand on courses of basic sciences, i.e. either physics or maths or something completely different, like Web development and Designing.

Let's dig into the content now. 

For basic knowledge of **circuits and electronics** you can try :

MIT 6.002 Circuits & Electronics 

[https://www.edx.org/course/circuits-electronics-1-basic-circuit-mitx-6-002-1](https://www.edx.org/course/circuits-electronics-1-basic-circuit-mitx-6-002-1x).

or [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfQxyVuLeCs&list=PL9F74AFA03AA06 A11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfQxyVuLeCs&list=PL9F74AFA03AA06)

It will give you an idea of why we study what we study. This is a must-do.

For those of you who enjoyed the **Digital Logic Design** course this semester,

# Non-Academia

Besides learning academically, you can try learning something else also like driving, or any other fun sport, say swimming or skating. Basically, do whatever you like. Read novels and blogs. You can even write your own blogs on Medium by making your account on it.

You can try some courses offered by the Department of Humanities too, like: **Public Speaking** (Resource: [Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/public-speaking/)) and **Communication Skills** (Resource: [Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-communication-skills)). Don't hesitate, you need to start somewhere! :D

**Read**

Books can show you new worlds (real and imagined) and speak with voices you may not encounter otherwise. College marks *(sadly)* the end of childhood and the start of an independent existence. Therefore it is imperative that you attempt to observe and understand the world around you. Push the limits of your comfort and use this time to read authors and subjects that you may not otherwise. Easy reading includes Ruskin Bond, Neil Gaiman, Agatha Christie, etc. For deeper reading, a theme-wise list of suggestions is provided below. This is of course not the best or exhaustive, but it is a start.

**Political Theory**

The Three Languages of Politics - Arnold Kling

Prisoners of Geography - Tim Marshall

Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari

The Clash of Civilisations


**Continental Philosophy**

Man's Search for Meaning - Viktor Frankl

The Stranger - Albert Camus

**Feminism**

A Room of One's Own - Virginia Woolf

Little Women - Louisa May Alcott

**Economics**

Economics in One Lesson - Henry Hazlitt

Freakonomics - Steven Dubner & Steven Levitt

Satire

Lord of The Flies - William Golding

1984 - George Orwell

**Random Cool Stuff**

The Rusty Series - Ruskin Bond

White Nights - Fyodor Dostoevsky

The Kingkiller Chronicles - Patrick Rothfuss

Dune - Frank Herbert

**Miscellaneous**

Principles of Microeconomics (MIT) - <https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-01sc-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2011/>
